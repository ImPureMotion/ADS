## Strategy Abstract

This ADS aims to equip cybersecurity analysts, especially junior analysts, with the knowledge and tools to identify malicious usage of `mshta.exe`. It covers the technical aspects, detection strategies, and mitigation techniques, while also addressing false positives and validation procedures.

---

## Technical Context

### What is `mshta.exe`?

`mshta.exe` is a Windows-native binary designed to execute Microsoft HTML Application (HTA) files. It can execute Windows Script Host code (VBScript and JScript) embedded within HTML.

### Common Paths

- `C:\Windows\System32\mshta.exe`
- `C:\Windows\SysWOW64\mshta.exe`

### Legitimate Usage

`mshta.exe` is primarily used to execute HTML applications (.hta files) that are locally stored. These HTML applications are often used for system administration tasks and internal applications within an organization.

### Malicious Usage

`mshta.exe` can be used to execute inline scripts, access alternate data streams, and download remote payloads. It has been exploited by malware like Kovter and Ursnif for malicious activities.

---

## Blind Spots and Assumptions

- Assumes that process and command-line monitoring are enabled.
- Assumes that the organization has a baseline of legitimate `mshta.exe` usage for comparison.

---

## False Positives

False positives could arise from legitimate parent processes, known command-line arguments, internal network references, and routine tasks.

---

## Validation

1. **Test Environment**: Create a controlled test environment to simulate both malicious and legitimate `mshta.exe` activities.
2. **Detection Rules**: Apply the detection analytics outlined in this ADS.
3. **Review**: Analyze the alerts generated to validate if they correctly identify malicious activities and minimize false positives.

---

## Priority

- **High**

---

## Response

1. **Immediate Isolation**: Isolate any system where malicious `mshta.exe` activity is detected.
2. **Investigation**: Conduct a thorough investigation to understand the scope and impact.
3. **Remediation**: Remove malicious artifacts and apply patches if needed.
4. **Update ADS**: Update this ADS based on lessons learned from the incident.
